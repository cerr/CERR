The DICOM Toolbox included with CERR includes slight 
modifications from the version created by Emiliano Spezi.

The dictionary ES - IPT4.1CompatibleDictionary.mat is used
in all calls to DICOMINFO and DICOMREAD.  GUI Prompts are
used to select the study number etc.  Calls to get rasterSegs
are modified slightly.

Other than this, the toolbox is identical to version 2.2.
