function maskM = getStructureMask(structNum, sliceNum, dim, planC)
%"getStructureMask"
%   Returns structure's mask on a specified slice number via uniformized
%   data.
%
%   structNum is the number of the requested structure
%   sliceNum is the slice NUMBER we want the structure on (not coordinate)
%   dim is the dimension (1,2,3 = x,y,z) that the slice should be taken
%   from.
%   planC is the plan (optional parameter: global is used if not passed)
%
%   WARNING: This function uses only uniformized data even if dim is 3 (for
%            zSlices).  In order to get the structure mask on a CT slice
%            via rasterSegments, use getRasterSegments and rasterToMask.
