% Usage
% [s, err_mse, iter_time]=greed_mp(x,P,m,'option_name','option_value')
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input
%   Mandatory:
%               x   Observation vector to be decomposed
%               P   Either:
%                       1) An nxm matrix (n must be dimension of x)
%                       2) A function handle (type "help function_format" 
%                          for more information)
%                          Also requires specification of P_trans option.
%                       3) An object handle (type "help object_format" for 
%                          more information)
%               m   length of s 
%
%   Possible additional options:
%   (specify as many as you want using 'option_name','option_value' pairs)
%   See below for explanation of options:
%__________________________________________________________________________
%   option_name         AVAILABLE OPTION_VALUES                 default
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%   stopCrit        M, CORR, MSE, MSE_CHANGE                    M
%   stopTol         NUMBER (SEE BELOW)                          n/4
%   P_trans         FUNCTION_HANDLE (SEE BELOW)                 
%   maxIter         POSITIVE INTEGER (SEE BELOW)                n
%   verbose         TRUE, FALSE                                 false
%   start_val       VECTOR OF LENGTH M                          zeros
%
%   Available stopping criteria :
%               M           -   Extracts exactly M = stopTol elements.
%               corr        -   Stops when maximum correlation between
%                               residual and atoms is below stopTol value.
%               mse         -   Stops when mean squared error of residual 
%                               is below stopTol value.
%               mse_change  -   Stops when the change in the mean squared 
%                               error falls below stopTol value.
%
%   stopTol: Value for stopping criterion.
%
%   P_trans: If P is a function handle, then P_trans has to be specified and 
%            must be a function handle. 
%
%   maxIter: Maximum of allowed iterations.
%
%   verbose: Logical value to allow algorithm progress to be displayed.
%
%   start_val: Allows algorithms to start from partial solution.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Outputs
%    s              Solution vector 
%    err_mse        Vector containing mse of approximation error for each 
%                   iteration
%    iter_time      Vector containing computation times for each iteration
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Description
%   greed_mp performs a greedy signal decomposition. 
%   In each iteration a new element is selected depending on the inner
%   product between the current residual and columns in P.
%   The single non-zero element associated with the largest inner product 
%   is then updated by adding the associated inner product.
%
%   THIS IS NOT THE FASTEST IMPLEMENTATION POSSIBLE! WE DO CALCULATE ALL
%   INNER PRODUCTS IN EACH ITERATION. FASTER IMPLEMENTATIONS WOULD USE
%   LOCAL UPDATES OF INNER PRODUCTS. USE [1] FOR A FASTER ALTERNATIVE!
