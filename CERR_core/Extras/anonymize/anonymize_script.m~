%anonymize_script.m
%Script to anonymize a CERR plan.
%This script loops over all cells with potential protected health
%information and replaces suspicious fields with a user-input string.
%The following fields should always be viewed suspiciously:
%{'studyNumberOfOrigin','PatientName','caseNumber','archive'}, and are
%automatically searched for and replaced with found by the entered
%replacment string.
